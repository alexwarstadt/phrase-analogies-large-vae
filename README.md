# lingua52-project
Project for MLLU class

## Setup

The following steps are necessary to setup the repository on your own device

### Download Pre Trained Models

In order to download the pretrained models, you should run the following command in your terminal

```bash
./download_pretrained_models.sh
```

This command will download all models listed from [the OPTIMUS repository](https://github.com/ChunyuanLI/Optimus/blob/master/doc/optimus_finetune_language_models.md) so it may take some time to run.

The models will be saved in a folder named `/pretrained_models` where they can be unzipped and used within your code
